# HealthData IQ â€“ Hospital Insights & Patient Analytics
## Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital performance and patient feedback across the United States using data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The analysis aims to uncover trends in quality, satisfaction, emergency services, and hospital types to support data-driven healthcare insights.

## Dataset Summary
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CMS/hospital-general-information
Data Columns: Hospital name, type, ownership, ratings, emergency services, mortality, readmission, safety, patient survey results, location.
Primary Focus: Hospital types, ratings, emergency service availability, quality metrics, and ownership.

## Data Cleaning
Removed rows with missing "County Name"
Dropped "Meets criteria for meaningful use of EHRs" and footnote columns due to high missing values
Converted key comparison columns (e.g., "Above the national average") to ordinal numeric scores
Converted "Hospital overall rating" to numeric for statistical use
Standardized column names and handled inconsistent values (e.g., "Not Available")

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Hospital Type and Ownership
The most common hospital type is "Acute Care Hospitals," indicating a skewed distribution.
"Voluntary non-profit - Private" and "Proprietary" are the most frequent ownership types.
2. Hospital Ratings by Ownership
Most ownership types show a median overall rating around 3.
"Physician"-owned hospitals show a slightly higher median.
The presence of "Not Available" ratings affects comparison reliability.
3. Emergency Services Availability
Among the top 10 states by hospital count, a high proportion of hospitals offer emergency services.
Emergency services are widely available in large states such as TX and CA.
4. Patient Experience
Most hospitals are rated "Same as the national average" for patient experience.
5. Correlation Analysis
Correlation between 'Hospital overall rating', 'ZIP Code', and 'Phone Number' is very weak.
A heatmap of correlations between overall rating and quality metric scores (mortality, readmission, safety, etc.) shows weak relationships, indicating these metrics measure distinct aspects.
6. Mortality Comparison
Many hospitals report mortality rates as "Same as the national average."
Significant counts also for "Below" and "Above" average.
7. Chi-Square Test: Hospital Type vs Patient Experience
Chi-Square Statistic: 1831.28
P-Value: 0.0000
Conclusion: Significant association between hospital type and patient experience ratings.
8. Boxplot Analysis
Boxplot visualizations show the spread and median of overall hospital ratings across ownership types.

## Visualizations
1. Histogram: Rating distributions
2. Bar Chart: Ratings by ownership
3. Pie Chart: Emergency service availability
4. Correlation Heatmap: Ratings vs quality metrics
5. Boxplot: Ratings by ownership type
6. Interactive Dashboard (Plotly):
7. Hospital Type Count
8. Hospital Ownership Distribution
9. Hospital Ratings by Ownership
10. Emergency Services Availability (Top 10 States)
11. Patient Experience Comparison Distribution

## Dashboard Implementation
Built Plotly
Features:
1. State and ownership filters
2. Dynamic charts and interactive visuals
3. Combined subplot layout for overview

## Key Insights
1. Acute Care and Non-Profit hospitals dominate the dataset.
2. Most hospitals have average ratings around 3.
3. Emergency services are widely accessible in states with more hospitals.
4. Weak correlations among quality metrics suggest independent performance indicators.
5. Patient experience significantly varies by hospital type.

## Limitations
High volume of missing data in quality metrics and rating fields.
Incomplete data limits statistical analysis robustness.

## Recommendations
Promote full reporting of quality metrics and overall ratings.
Use quality metrics as complementary indicators of performance.
Improve data completeness in future datasets.

Tools Used
Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
